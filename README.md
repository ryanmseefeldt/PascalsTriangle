Pascal's Triangle Generator

This Java program generates Pascal's triangle with the number of rows entered by the user, utilizing recursion.

How it works

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.

This program generates Pascal's triangle recursively. Here's how it works:

The user inputs the number of rows they want in the triangle.
The program recursively calculates each number in the triangle based on the binomial coefficient formula.
The triangle is displayed to the user.
The user can continue to generate triangles until they quit the program.
Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the Java file using Pascal.java.
Run the compiled Java program using java Pascal.
Select generate.
Enter the number of rows you want for Pascal's triangle when prompted.
The program will generate and display the triangle for you.
