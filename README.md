Pascal's Triangle or Fractals
There are times when using recursion leads to a more elegant solution than iteration.  
Here are a couple of examples.  As a group, please research either Pascal's Triangle 
or the sample fractal program in chapter 18 of your book.  I want you to create 
either a sample of Pascal's Triangle or a version of a GUI version of a 
Fractal (Your choice). Each member of your team must fully understand how the code works.
